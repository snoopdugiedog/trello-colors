# Trello Colors

Those little labels on Trello are hard to distinguish at a glance.
This project is to make it so that you can see all the labels on a trello board at a glance.

Currently the style makes each label a full width bar on the card.

You can then either add the css to your user styles in chrome, or using stylish in firefox.

As of April 25, 2014 this style displays correctly in firefox.
